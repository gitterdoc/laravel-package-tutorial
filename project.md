# Create a laravel project
> **NOTE:** If you already have an laravel project or an site, you can skip this step!

After [installation of laravel](install.md), you can create your project. Navigate to your path you want.

For sample, we using following path:

 - **Linux:** `/opt/laravel/`
 - **Windows:** `D:/laravel/`
 
We navigate with the `CLI`, [Putty](https://www.putty.org/), `CMD`, [GitBash](https://windows.github.com) or some other command line tool to our path. Navigate to the root directory!
 
**Linux**
```
 $ cd /opt
```
 
 **Windows**
```
  D:
  cd D:/
```
> **NOTE:** If you're using the default `CMD` from `Windows`, you must change the drive with `<DRIVE>:` (for sample `D:`, `C:` or what you want) if you're working on an external hard drive!

Let's install our laravel project with:
```
laravel new <projectName>
```

Our `<projectName>` is by default `laravel`.

That's it is, laravel will be installed (it takes some time) and this step is finished!
